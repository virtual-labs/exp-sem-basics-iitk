#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: summative

<u> <b>Description: </b> of how you are going to implement the above Instructional Strategy in your Simulator: </u>
<br>
1. Mimic the actual instrument using animation.
2. The real images will be added to get the feeling as one operates the instrument

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Students play with the controller and understand the function of the instrument |Simulator enables the virtual operation of the SEM instrument | Learning about the operation of the instrument
2.| Students will acquire SE image | Simulator will enable the students to play with the virtual controllers and understand its operation. | Learning about the different modes of imaging in SEM
3.| Students will acquire BSE image | Simulator will guide the students about the steps to be followed | To learn the different contrast mechanism in SEM
